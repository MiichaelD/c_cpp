1) There is a bug when a piece is in a negative column (if the left side of the piece's matrix is 0) and we rotate it, we might lose some cells going out of the board:

	Before rotating a piece check if its in a negative column, if so, try to move it to the right and then rotate, if not, we are not able to rotate!

Note: this same bug happens on the right side of the board.


2) Board should be clearing it's lines each tick, instead of having the Game class taking care of it. Also board should have a pointer to a "LinesClearedListener" (or think of a better name) interface, so each time the board clears any amount of lines it let the listerner know that such event happen. 


3) Add a nicer UI instead of just the terminal. Also improve the terminal controls.
